Concept:
Gamers Platform is a discussion forum for Steam games that offers a Reddit-like experience.
The forum would be divided by game, and sub-forums divided by category (discussion, guides, news, etc.).
Posts and comments would use Reddit's score system. User profile shows user's posts, comments, and elements from Steam profile.

Possibly authenticate using Steam account.
