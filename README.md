# TalkNerdytoMe
# ProjectThree

Concept:

  Talk Nerdy to Me is a blog directed towards gamers who want to write about their experiences during or after the game is played. A few components would be adding videos or photos to their blog, no legth requirement for the writing portion, ability to comment and share on their own and others blogs. The goal of these components is to help share their experiences by being as detailed or using as little detail as the user would like. On our landing page will have a sign in requirement. From there, it will open the home page where the user can access their blog and other bloggers posts. There will be an option to connect with "Steam" since we will be implementing the steam API, where they can connect to their steam account and switch back and forth from the blog to the game and catagories to choose from so clients may search the game blog they are wanting to read.
